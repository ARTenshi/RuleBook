% TODO

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Robot A fails at all manipulation attemps but makes an excelent report, with the 5 known objects labeled correctly and the 5 pairs of unknown objects correctly, will get 
% $5*10 + 5*15 = 125$ points. 
%  \item Robot B that fails to recognize anything but does move all the objects from the table to anywhere in the cupboard receives $5*10 + 5*10 = 100$ points.
%  \item Robot C grasps a single unknown item (\quotes{Cookies}), places it at the correct position near the other \quotes{Cookies} and also makes the same excelent report as robot A will get 
% 10 points for grasping, 10 foor placing anywhere and an additional 5 for placing at the right location, so 25 for that single object.
% The  total for robot C is then 150 points.
