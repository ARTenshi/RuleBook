\section{Carry My Luggage}
\label{test:carry-my-luggage}
The robot helps the operator to carry their luggage to a car which is parked outside.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI{}, \HRI{}, \PerDet{}, \PerRec, \NAV{}, \MAP{}.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
The robot helps the operator to carry a bag to a location outside the arena.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts.

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Re-entering the arena (100 pts).
	\item Avoid bonus obstacles (400 pts, 100pts per obstacle).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts at a predefined location. Time starts when the operator steps in front of the robot.
 	
 	\item \textbf{Car Location:} A location outside the arena. Not announced before the test.

 	\item \textbf{Bags:} At least two bags (see~\ref{sec:rules:scenario:objects}) are placed near the operator, visible to the robot.

	\item \textbf{Operator}: The operator is standing in front of the robot pointing at the bag to be carried out. The robot should indicate when it is ready to follow. The operator walks naturally towards the car.
	
	\item \textbf{Obstacles:} On request, 4 obstacles will be placed along the way in any order:
	\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item a crowd obstructing the path,
		\item a small object on the ground,
		\item a hard-to-see 3D object,
		and
		\item a small area blocked using retractable barriers.
	\end{enumerate*}

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied as follows.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]

\item Handing the bag over (-100 pts).
\item Re-finding the operator while following them:
		\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item Natural interaction (e.g.~wave and calling) 100pts score reduction.
		\item Non-natural interaction (e.g.~raising both hands and jumping) 200pts score reduction.
		 		\item Moving back (e.g.~ask the operator to step back in front of the robot) 300pts score reduction.
		\item Touching the robot (e.g.~pulling the robot's hand) 400pts score reduction.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
The referees need to
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Choose the car's location.
	\item Place bags next to operator.
	\item Place obstacles if requested.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{OC Instructions}
2h before test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Select and announce the robot's starting position.
	\item Select which bags will be used.
	\item Recruit volunteers to be the crowd obstructing the path
\end{itemize}
