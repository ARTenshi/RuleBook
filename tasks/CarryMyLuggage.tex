\section{Carry My Luggage [Party Host]}
\label{test:carry-my-luggage}
The robot helps the operator to carry some luggage to a car which is parked outside.

\subsection*{Focus}
Object identification and manipulation, person following, and social navigation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
The robot helps the operator to carry a bag to a car parked outside.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts.

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Reentering the \Arena{} (100pts)
	\item Avoiding all obstacles (400pts, 100pts per obstacle)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place both inside and outside the \Arena{}.
	\item \textbf{Start location}: The robot starts at a predefined location in the living room.
	\item \textbf{Bags:} At least two bags are placed near the operator (within a 2m distance and visible to the robot).
	\item \textbf{Operator}: The operator is standing in front of the robot and is pointing at the bag to be carried out.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Obstacles:} The robot will face 4 obstacles along its way (in any arbitrary order):
	\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item a small object on the ground,
		\item a hard-to-see object,
		\item a crowd of people obstructing the path outside, and
		\item a small area blocked using retractable barriers.
	\end{enumerate*}

	\item \textbf{Car location:} There is no real car outside; instead, a fixed location outside the \Arena{} is designated as a car location.

	\item \textbf{Reaching the car:} The robot can reach the car location only by following the operator (the location is unknown before the test).

	\item \textbf{Following the operator:} The robot should inform the operator when it is ready to follow them. The operator walks naturally towards the car; after reaching the car, the operator takes the bag back and thanks the robot.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reductions for human assistance are applied as follows:
	\begin{table}[h]
		\begin{tabular}{m{0.8\linewidth} c}
			\textbf{Action} & \textbf{Reduction} \\\hline
			Handing over the bag to the robot & 100pts \\
			Finding the operator while following them: & \\
			\hspace{0.5cm}- Natural interaction (e.g. waving and calling) & 100pts \\
			\hspace{0.5cm}- Non-natural interaction (e.g. raising both hands and jumping) & 200pts \\
			\hspace{0.5cm}- Touching the robot (e.g. pulling the robot's hand) & 400pts \\\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Referee Instructions}

The referees need to:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Select one volunteer to act as the operator.
	\item Select three to four people to obstruct the robot's path outside.
	\item Choose positions for the bags and assign a bag to the operator.
	\item Choose which obstacles the robot will face outside while following the operator.
	\item Designate a location outside as a car location.
	\item Mind the robot when it goes outside the \Arena{}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC Instructions}

2h before test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Select and announce the robot's starting point.
	\item Select which bags will be used in the test.
\end{itemize}
