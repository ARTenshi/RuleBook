\section{Carry My Luggage}
\label{test:carry-my-luggage}
The robot helps the operator to carry their luggage to a car which is parked outside.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI{}, \HRI{}, \PerDet{}, \PerRec, \NAV{}, \MAP{}.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
The robot helps the operator to carry a bag to a location outside the arena.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Re-enter the arena (100 pts)
	\item Avoid crowd while following (200pts)
	\item Avoid small and hard-to-see objects when going back to arena (50pts each)
	\item Avoid retractable barrier (100pts)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts at a predefined location. Time starts when the operator steps in front of the robot.
 	
 	\item \textbf{Car Location:} A location outside the arena. Not announced before the test. The operator tells the robot that they reached the car. The main goal is completed when the robot places the bag close to the car location.

 	\item \textbf{Bags:} At least two bags (see~\ref{sec:rules:scenario:objects}) are placed near the operator, visible to the robot.

	\item \textbf{Operator}: The operator is standing in front of the robot pointing at the bag to be carried out. The robot should indicate when it is ready to follow. The operator walks naturally towards the car.
	
	\item \textbf{Obstacles:} On request, 4 obstacles will be placed along the way:
	\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item the operator moves through a crowd while the robot follows,
		\item a small object on the ground,
		\item a hard-to-see 3D object,
		and
		\item retractable barriers blocking area near the entrance (robot can still move around it).
	\end{enumerate*}

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied as follows.
	
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Request Bag Handover}: Asking to hand over the bag causes a score reduction of 100pts.
	
		\item \textbf{Re-find by Signaling}: Asking the operator to wave or call causes a score reduction of 100pts.
	
		\item \textbf{Re-find by Moving Backwards}: Asking the operator to move backwards causes a score reduction of 250pts.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
