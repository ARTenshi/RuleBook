\section{Where is This? [Party Host]}
The robot has to explain to people where they can find places in the arena.


\subsection{Main Goal}
People will approach the robot and ask where they can find a location in the arena (i.e. "Where is the TV?"). The robot has to either accurately describe the location from the other persons perspective (i.e. "It is to your right..." or "Turn around and go towards...") or guide the person there.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts (50pts per described location).

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Locations:} All predefined locations inside the arena.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	 \item Instead of describing the location the robot may guide the person there but this will probably take more time.
	 \item Three of the guests will come back later to ask for further instructions. I.e. "Where is the TV?" - "It is in the room behind you in the rightmost corner" - later - "I only found the sofa" - "The TV is to the left of the sofa". The robot has to remember where the person wanted to go in the first place. If the robot cannot give further instructions no points are awarded for this specific description.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}
The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assign locations to persons.
	\item Assign follow up questions to three persons.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OC instructions}
2 hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Announce where the robot has to wait for people to approach.
\end{itemize}
