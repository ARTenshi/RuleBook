\section{Where is This? [Party Host]}
The robot has to explain to people where they can find places in the arena.


\subsection{Main Goal}
People will approach the robot and ask where they can find a location in the arena (i.e. "Where is the TV?"). The robot has to either accurately describe the location from the other persons perspective (i.e. "It is to your right..." or "Turn around and go towards...") or guide the person there.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1000pts (100pts per described location).

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Recognize when a person returns and help them again. 250 (50 pts each).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Locations:} All predefined locations inside the arena.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	 \item Instead of describing the location the robot may guide the person there but this will probably take more time.
	 \item Five of the guests will come back later to ask for further instructions. I.e. "Where is the TV?" - "It is in the room behind you in the rightmost corner" - later - "I only found the sofa" - "The TV is to the left of the sofa". The robot has to remember where the person wanted to go in the first place. If the robot can give advanced instructions based on the location that the person found the bonus points are awarded.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}
The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assign locations to persons.
	\item Assign follow up questions to five persons.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OC instructions}
2 hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Announce where the robot has to wait for people to approach.
\end{itemize}
