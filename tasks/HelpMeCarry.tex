\section{Help Me Carry [Party Host]}
The robot helps a guest to carry some luggage to his/her car.

\subsection{Main Goal}
Robot helps a guest to carry a bag to the car which is parked outside and comes back home.

\subsection{Focus}
It includes understanding pointing gesture, object identification and manipulation, navigation in known and unknown environments, person-following while carrying a luggage, and social navigation.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500 pts for carrying the bag to the car's location and coming back home.

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Find the bag by understanding the pointing behaviour (100 pts).
	\item Avoid all the obstacles outdoor (400 pts).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts at a predefined location in the living room.

	\item \textbf{Guest}: There is only one guest in the house, standing in front of the robot at the start.
	
	\item \textbf{Bags' Location:} There are at least two bags placed between one to two meters  away from the guest's start position and both should be visible to the robot.
	
	\item \textbf{Pointing to the Bag:} When the test starts, the guest points to his/her bag and requests the robot to carry it to the car.
	
	\item \textbf{Outdoor Obstacles:} The robot will face multiple obstacles outside. The obstacles may include a person, a group of people, a stationary object or a moving object.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied as follows.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item help in finding the bag (-100 pts).
		\item help in carrying the bag (-100 pts).
		\item help in tracking the guest (-200pts).
		\item help in going back home (-100pts).
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Pointing to the Bag:} The guest keeps pointing to the bag and does not move. 

	\item \textbf{Car Location:} There is no car outside. Instead, a fixed location is supposed as a car location outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Reaching the Car:} The robot can reach the car's location only by following the guest. After the robot reaches the car's location, the guest says "Stop following me".
	
	%\item \textbf{Coming Back Home:} The robot should come back home by itself.
	
\end{enumerate}
