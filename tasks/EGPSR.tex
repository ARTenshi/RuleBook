\section{Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot}
\label{test:egpsr}
The robot can be asked to do anything involving abilities required in \SONE{} and \STWO{} of this rulebook.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI{}.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Execute 3 commands requested by the operator.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1500pts (500 points per command).

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Understand a command given by naive operator (150pts, each).
	\item Autonomously leaving the arena (100pts).
	\item Complete all 3 commands in time with minimal help (200pts).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Location:} The test mostly takes place inside the arena (some commands might require the robot to go outside).
	
	\item \textbf{Instruction Point:} An instruction point is assigned inside the arena where the robot has to go to receive a command.

	\item \textbf{Operators:} A \emph{professional} operator (i.e.~the referee) gives the commands. Optionally, teams can choose to receive commands by a \emph{naive} operator who has no background in robotics, i.e., an audience member. If the robot consistently fails to understand a command, the team can use a \CustomOperator{}

	\item \textbf{Command Generator:} Commands will be generated using the official \CommandGen{} available 2 months prior to the competition in the official repository\footnotemark \footnotetext{\url{https://github.com/kyordhel/GPSRCmdGen}}.
	
	\item \textbf{Minimal Help:} To score this bonus, the robot needs to complete the commands while requesting relatively few \abb{DEMs} compared to other teams. This is up to the consideration of the \abb{TC}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial (per command) scoring.
	
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per given command as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Custom Operator:} Choosing a custom operator causes a score reduction of 100pts.
		\item \textbf{Further Assistance:} Helping a robot accomplish a task causes a score reduction in line with \ref{sec:rules:demscoring} and other \STWO{} tests.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Provide the commands to the operators.
	\item Make sure the \Arena{} is in normal condition.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{OC Instructions}
\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Generate commands.
	\item Announce the location of the instruction point.
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}
