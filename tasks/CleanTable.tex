\section{Clean the Table [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:clean-the-table}
The robot has to remove all dishes from a table and place them into the dishwasher.\\

\noindent \textbf{Main goals:} All tableware and cutlery on the table is placed inside the dishwasher (six objects in total).\\

\noindent \textbf{Optional goals:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the dishwasher door
	\item Pulling out the dishwasher racks
	\item Placing a dishwasher tab inside the dishwasher
	\item Leaving the \Arena{}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Focus}
\emph{Object perception}, \emph{manipulation in narrow spaces}, and \emph{task planning}.

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} This test takes place in the \Arena{}.
	\item \textbf{Dining table:} A dining table is located close to the dishwasher.
	\item \textbf{Tray:} A plastic tray is located either on top of the dishwasher or on one of the racks. The tray may have other tableware and cutlery placed inside.
	\item \textbf{Table setting:} The table has a total of six objects disposed in a typical setting for a meal for one person.
	The object distribution is as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item\textit{Silverware}: Any two objects (fork, knife, or spoon).
		\item\textit{Tableware}: Any three objects (excluding silverware), at least one of which one must be a dish.
		\item\textit{Dishwasher tab}: One dishwasher tab.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safe placing:} Objects must be placed with care, namely the robot should place rather than throw or drop objects.
	\item \textbf{Dishwasher:} The team decides whether the robot will place the objects in the dishwasher's rack or in the plastic tray.
	\item \textbf{Dishwasher door:} The dishwasher door is open and with the racks pulled out by default.
	The team leader can, however, request the dishwasher to be closed for bonus points. If the robot fails to open the door, it must clearly state this and request the referee to open the door.
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} The scores are reduced if human assistance is received, in particular:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item pointing to an object or telling to the robot where an object is
		\item handing an object over to the robot
		\item having a human place tableware or cutlery inside the dishwasher
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
