\section{Restaurant}
The robots are tested in a real environment such as a real restaurant or a shopping mall. The test should be executed without a map at the start.
There are \emph{two} robots of different teams helping clients in the restaurant at the same time.

% \subsection{Focus}
% This test focuses on online mapping, safe navigation in previously unknown environments, gesture detection, human-robot interaction, and manipulation in a real environment.

\subsection{Main Goal}
Taking two orders from the guests and serving the guests with the requested orders. Before taking the order, the robot can be guided by a \textit{Professional Waiter} (member of the TC). During delivering phase, the robot should finds its own way.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1000pts, 350 regular per order + 150 bonus per order

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Detection of guest requesting service by gesture or calling (75pts)
	\item Arriving at table of the guest without guidance (75pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} A real restaurant fully equipped with a \enquote{Professional Barman} i.e.~the operator and at least three tables with \enquote{Professional Clients}.
    \item \textbf{Kitchen-bar:} The \textit{Kitchen-bar} will be a table located at the restaurant's kitchen, next to the place where the robot started. It has the following setup.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Barman:} A \textit{Professional Barman} (member of the TC) will be at the other side of the \textit{Kitchen-bar} to take the order provided by the robot and serve it in the official tray.
		\item \textbf{Items:} Items will be located on the Kitchen-bar next to the \textit{Professional Barman}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safety!} This test takes place in a public area. That is, there may be people standing, sitting or walking around the area throughout the test. The robot is expected to not even slightly touch anything and is immediately stopped in case of danger.

	\item \textbf{Referees and guidance:} For safety reasons, the referees in this test are TC members. One of the referees follows the robot and is always in reach of the emergency button.

    \item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per order as follows.
        \begin{itemize}[nosep]
          \item Needing guidance during the deliver phase causes a reduction of 40\% in scoring.
          \item Needing assistance for picking up an item/the tray causes a reduction of 10\% in scoring.
          \item Have a human place the item in a basket causes a reduction of 20\% in scoring.
          \item Have the guest take the item out of the basket causes a reduction of 20\% in scoring.
          \item Asking the barman at which side the \textit{Kitchen-bar} is causes a reduction of 5\% in the total scoring.
        \end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Start:} There is no fixed start signal in this test, it starts when both robots are ready (though within a reasonable time).

	\item \textbf{Order:} The way the user provides information to the robot is up to the robot's team. A natural interaction is preferred.

	\item \textbf{Location:} This test can be arranged in any real restaurant or shopping mall. If this is not possible, the test can be conducted in an arbitrary room containing the appropriate locations. The only requirement is that this room is not part of the arena and that the teams do not know the room beforehand.
	  The exact location, including the object and delivery locations, will be defined by the technical committee on site (and in corporation with the local organization). In addition, to avoid unnecessary time investment for navigation, the distances between tables and the \enquote{Kitchen Bar} will be minimal. Because the location can be anywhere, nearby electrical outlets and Wi-Fi access can't be guaranteed.

	\item \textbf{Disturbances from outside:} If a person from the audience (severely) interferes with the robot in a way that makes it impossible to solve the task, the teams may repeat the test immediately.

	\item \textbf{Instruction:} The robot interacts with the operators, not the team. That is, the team is not allowed to instruct the \textit{Professional Barman}. All instructions should be provided by the robot itself.
	It is not allowed to the team to instruct the clients on how to get robot's attention. It shall be done in a natural way like when interacting with a human waiter.

    \item \textbf{Map:} The area of the test is not allowed to be mapped before the test. Mapping can be started just before starting the robot.

    \item \textbf{Two robots:} This test is executed with two robots working parallel. A robot driving into an other robot is disqualified from this test. A robot preventing the other robot to execute this test by (severely) interferes is also disqualified from this test.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}

The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prepare orders for each client in advance, so that there can be no confusion. These orders must also be available at the kitchen.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OC instructions}
During Setup days:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Check with local (security) management if the possible location, including a sufficient queuing area, can be used for the restaurant test.
\end{itemize}

1 hour before the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Gather all teams and robots to move to some nearby queuing area and instruct the teams how/when to move to the actual test location.
\end{itemize}
