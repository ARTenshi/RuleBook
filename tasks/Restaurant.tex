\section{Restaurant}
\label{test:restaurant}
The robot takes and serves orders to several customers in a real restaurant.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI{}, \NAV{}, \MAP{}, \HRI{}, \MAN{}, \PerDet{}, \OR{}.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Take and serve orders from 2 customer.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 1000pts (500pts per order)

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Use an unattached tray to transport an order(250pts each)
	\item Transport two orders at once (250pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} A real restaurant fully equipped and in business. There may be real customers and waiters around. The location is not announced beforehand.

	\item \textbf{Start Location:} The robot starts next to the bar.

	\item \textbf{Customers:} There are multiple tables with people. At least two people at different tables have orders. People who want to order wave or call the robot.
	
	\item \textbf{Orders:} People can order one or two objects. Orders must be placed on the customer's table.

    \item \textbf{Bar:} A table located near the restaurant's kitchen on which objects that can be ordered are placed. All edible/drinkable \KnownObjects{} can be ordered.

	\item \textbf{Barman:} A member of the \abb{TC} is standing by the bar to assist the robot on request. The barman will handover orders or place them in a basket or tray.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Safety First:} This test takes place in a public area. Therefore, referees will be more careful and will not tolerate even slight collisions.
	
	\item \textbf{Fair Play:} Upon arrival to the restaurant, only two team members are allowed next to the robot. Tweaking, coding, debugging, or mapping the area will lead to immediate disqualification.
	
	\item \textbf{Power outlets, WiFi and ECRA:} The availability of wireless, external computing devices, or electrical outlets can't be guaranteed. Assume unavailability.
	
	\item \textbf{Disturbances from Outside:} If a person from the audience (severely) interferes with the robot in a way that makes it impossible to solve the task, the teams may repeat the test immediately.
	
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial (per order) scoring.
	
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per order as follows.
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item\textbf{Asking for Directions:} Receiving directions, verbally or by pointing, reduces the score by 25pts.
		\item\textbf{Being Guided:} Being guided to a table causes a score reduction of 200pts.
		\item\textbf{Wrong Orders:} Delivering a wrong object reduces score by 350pts if at least part of the order is correct. Reduction of 500pts otherwise.
		\item\textbf{Handing Orders:} Handing objects to the customer instead of placing them causes a score reduction of 100pts.
	\end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prepare orders for each customer.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{OC Instructions}
During Setup days:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Check with local (security) management if the possible location, including a sufficient queuing area, can be used for the restaurant test.
\end{itemize}
1 hour before the test:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item Gather all teams and robots to move to some nearby queuing area and instruct the teams how/when to move to the actual test location.
