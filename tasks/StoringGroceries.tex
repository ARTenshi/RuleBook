\section{Storing Groceries [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:storing-groceries}
The robot stores groceries into a cabinet with shelves. Objects are sorted on the shelves based on similarity, for instance an apple is stored next to other fruits.

\subsection*{Focus}
Detection and recognition of objects and their features, object manipulation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Move five objects from a table to the cabinet, grouping them by category or similarity.

\subsection*{Optional Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the cabinet door
	\item Moving a \emph{tiny} object
	\item Moving a \emph{heavy} object
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Location:} The testing area has a cabinet and a table nearby.
	\item \textbf{Table:} The table has 5--10 objects placed on it and the robot can choose which ones to grasp and in what order. On small tables, objects will be added as the robot frees up space.
	\item \textbf{Cabinet:} The cabinet contains objects arranged in groups --- either by category or likeliness --- on different shelves.
	\item \textbf{Cabinet door:} The cabinet door is open by default, but the team leader can request the door to be closed and score additional points for opening it. If the robot fails to open the door, it must clearly state it and request the referee to open it.
	\item \textbf{Objects:} Some of the objects are placed behind the door and cannot be accessed unless the door is open.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Table:} The table's rough location will be announced beforehand, having its position to the left, right, or behind the robot.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item telling or pointing out to the robot where to place an object
		\item moving an object instead of the robot
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{OC Instructions}
