\section{Storing Groceries}
\label{test:storing-groceries}
The robot stores groceries into a pantry shelf while adhering to how objects are arranged in it, i.e., storing an apple next to other fruits.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI, \MAN, \CV, \OR.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on the detection and recognition of objects and their features, as well as object manipulation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Move 5 objects from a table into a shelf, grouping them by category or similarity.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts (100pts per object).

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the shelf door (100pts).
	\item Moving a \emph{tiny} object (200pts).
	\item Moving a \emph{heavy} object (200pts).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Location:} The testing area has a shelf and a table nearby.

	\item \textbf{Shelf:} The shelf contains objects arranged in groups either by category or likeliness.

	\item \textbf{Shelf Door:} The shelf door is open by default.
	The team leader can request the door to be closed and score additional points for opening it. If the robot fails to open the door, it must clearly state it and request the referee to open it.

	\item \textbf{Objects:} Some of the objects are placed behind the door and cannot be accessed unless the door is open.
	
	\item \textbf{Heavy and Tiny Objects:} Objects used in this test are lightweight and average-sized.
	The team leader can, however, request a tiny and a heavy object to be used and score additional points for picking them.

	\item \textbf{Table} The table's rough location will be announced beforehand, having its position either left, right, or behind the robot.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial (per object) scoring.
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per object as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item Telling or pointing out to the robot where to place an object results in a score reduction of 30pts.
		\item Since the test focuses on manipulation, asking a human to handle an object results in full score reduction.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Place objects in the shelf, grouping them by likeliness.
	\item Place 5--10 objects on the table.
	\item Ask teams whether they want the shelf door opened.
	\item Ask teams whether they want a heavy or tiny object.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC Instructions}

\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Announce which table and shelf will be used in the test.
	\item Announce a rough location for the table.
\end{itemize}
