\section{Clean Up [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:clean-up}
Inside one room in the arena are some misplaced objects. The robot has to clean up that room, throwing to the garbage the unrecognized ones.

% \subsection*{Focus}
% This test focuses on object perception, manipulation, and planning.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Find six misplaced objects in a room and bring them to their predefined locations.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 600pts (100pts per object).

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Moving a \emph{tiny} object (200pts)
	\item Moving a \emph{heavy} object (200pts)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} A random room in the arena.
	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the arena at a predefined location near the entrance door.
	\item \textbf{Instruction:} Nearby the entrance, an operator tells the robot which room to clean.
	\item \textbf{Objects:} There are 6--10 misplaced objects at random locations in the room.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Objects:}
	Objects can be anywhere, including the floor, seats, and on furniture.
	All objects are clearly visible (i.e.~no occlusions) and can be:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item\textit{Known objects}: Regular and alike objects.
		\item\textit{Unknown objects}: Garbage lying around at grasping distance (2--3 objects).
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per object as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item Telling the robot where an object can be found causes a reduction of 30pts in scoring for that particular object.

		\item Pointing at an object to be picked up causes a reduction of 40pts in scoring for that particular object.

		\item Guiding the robot nearby the location where an object can be found causes a reduction of 20pts in scoring for that particular object.

		\item Telling the robot where the object should be placed or the object's category causes a reduction of 30pts in scoring for that particular object.

		\item Having a human physically interacting with an object causes a reduction of 60pts in scoring for that particular object.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Heavy and tiny objects:} Objects used in this test are lightweight and average-sized.
	The team leader can, however, request a tiny and a heavy object to be used and score additional points for picking them.

	\item \textbf{Bin:} Objects must be placed inside the bin, not thrown or dropped.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Place the objects in the room.
	\item Recover disposed objects from the bin.
	\item Ask teams whether they want a heavy or tiny object.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC instructions}
2 hours before the test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Announce the starting location of the robot.
\end{itemize}
