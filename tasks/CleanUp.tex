\section{Clean Up [Housekeeper]}
\label{test:clean-up}

The robot has to tidy up an arena room with some misplaced objects, placing unknown objects in a garbage bin.

\subsection*{Focus}
This test focuses on task planning, object perception, and manipulation.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Find all misplaced objects in a room and bring them to their predefined locations.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500pts (100pts per object).

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the entrance door autonomously (200pts)
	\item Moving a \emph{tiny} object (150pts)
	\item Moving a \emph{heavy} object (150pts)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} A random room in the arena.
	\item \textbf{Instruction:} Near the entrance, an operator tells the robot which room to clean.
	\item \textbf{Objects:} There are 5--10 misplaced objects at random locations in the room.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Objects:}
	Objects can be anywhere in the room, including the floor, seats, and on top of furniture.
	All objects are clearly visible (i.e. no occlusions) and can be:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item\textit{Known objects}: Regular and alike objects.
		\item\textit{Unknown objects}: Garbage lying around (2--3 objects).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Heavy and tiny objects:} Objects used in this test are lightweight and average-sized.
	The team leader can, however, request a tiny and a heavy object to be used in order to score additional points for picking them.

	\item \textbf{Bin:} Objects must be placed inside the bin, not thrown or dropped.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reductions for requesting human assistance are applied \emph{per each object} as follows:
	\begin{table}[h]
		\begin{tabular}{m{0.8\linewidth} c}
			\textbf{Action} & \textbf{Reduction} \\\hline
			Guiding the robot to a location where an object can be found & 20\% \\
			Telling the robot where an object can be found & 30\% \\
			Telling the robot the object's category or where the object should be placed & 30\% \\
			Pointing at an object to be picked up & 40\% \\
			Having a human physically interact with an object & 60\% \\\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
The referee needs to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Place objects in the room.
	\item Recover disposed objects from the bin.
	\item Ask teams whether they want a heavy or a tiny object to be used.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC Instructions}
Announce the starting location of the robot 2 hours before the test.
