\section{General Purpose Service Robot}
\label{test:gpsr}
The robot can be asked to do anything involving abilities required in \SONE{} of this rulebook.

\noindent \textbf{Focus:} \SysI.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
Execute 3 commands requested by the operator.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 750pts (250 points per command)

\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Understand a command given by naive operator (50pts, each)
	\item Autonomously leaving the arena after completing all 3 commands (100pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Location:} The test mostly takes place inside the arena (some commands might require the robot to go outside).
	
	\item \textbf{Instruction Point:} An instruction point is assigned inside the arena where the robot has to go to receive a command.
	
	\item \textbf{Operators:} A \emph{professional} operator (i.e.~the referee) gives the commands. Optionally, teams can choose to receive commands by a \emph{naive} operator who has no background in robotics, i.e., an audience member. The team can decide to use a \CustomOperator{} outright or after the robot fails to understand the professional or naive operator.
	
	\item \textbf{Command Generator:} Commands will be generated using the official \CommandGen{} available 2 months prior to the competition in the official repository\footnotemark \footnotetext{\url{https://github.com/kyordhel/GPSRCmdGen}}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Not Going to Instruction Point:} If the robot requests commands from somewhere else than the instruction point, a score reduction of 50 pts is applied.
	
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial (per command) scoring.
		
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per given command as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Custom Operator:} Choosing a custom operator to understand a command causes a score reduction of 50pts.
		\item \textbf{Alternative HRI:} Using an alternative HRI to understand a command causes a score reduction of 75pts.
		\item \textbf{Further Assistance:} Helping a robot accomplish a task causes a score reduction in line with \ref{sec:rules:demscoring} and other \SONE{} tests.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Referee Instructions}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]

\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
 	\item Generate commands.
	\item Announce the location of the instruction point.
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
