\section{Find My Mates [Party Host]}
\label{test:find-my-mates}

The robot collects some information about various party guests for the operator, who only knows the names of the guests.

\subsection*{Main Goal}

Report the description and location of two party guests to the operator.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 500 points (250pts per guest).
