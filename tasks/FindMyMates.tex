\section{Find My Mates [Party Host]}

The robot starts in a room and waits for someone to approach it. The guest knows the name of other guests at the party but doesnâ€™t know how these people look like and where the people are. The robot will gather this information for the guest.


\subsection{Main Goal}
The robot provides the location and unique description of 3 guests of the party as required by another guest.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 750 points (250 points per guest).

\subsection{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Robot providing unique description of a person without having asked such information (75 points)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The robot is in a predefined room at least one person that will approach it.

	\item \textbf{People}: 5 people distributed around the house.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction for requesting human assistance is applied per guest.

	\item \textbf{Calling the operator for the final answer:} 50\% reduction if the robot does not go back autonomously to the operator to report the information.
	
	\item \textbf{Penalty:} If the robot talks to an empty room or does not clearly face a person or crowd when talking (e.g. speaks to a wall), -75 points of penalty.
\end{enumerate}
