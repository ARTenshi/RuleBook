% \subsection{Focus}

	\item Closing the apartment door (100pts)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup}

	\item \textbf{Location:} This test takes place in the arena and its immediate exterior.
	\item \textbf{Interior Bins:} There are three bins in the apartment for trash, recycling and compost.
	\item \textbf{Exterior Bins:} There are three larger bins outside the apartment. They may have lids covering their contents.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
