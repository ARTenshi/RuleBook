\section{Farewell [Party Host]}
\label{test:farewell}
Some party guests call the robot to retrieve their coats so they can leave.
It is also raining outside and there is only one umbrella, so the robot takes the guests to their cab one by one and returns with the umbrella.

\subsection*{Focus}
This test focuses on human detection, safe navigation, and human-robot interaction.

\subsection*{Main Goal}
The robot escorts two tired guests to their cab, where a cab driver is standing.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 600pts (300pts per guest).

\subsection*{Bonus rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Delivering the correct coats to the two guests (150pts per guest)
	\item Identifying the female guest and escorting her first (100pts)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place both inside and outside the arena.
	\item \textbf{Start location}: The robot starts inside the arena.
	\item \textbf{Guests}: There are five people in the living room - three sitting and two standing. At least two of them are female.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial (per guest) scoring.

	\item \textbf{Guests}: All guests have a name and a coat color assigned.

	\item \textbf{Calling the robot}: Guests willing to leave call the robot (e.g. by waving or shouting) simultaneously.

	\item \textbf{Kicking out guests:} Non-calling guests will refuse to leave the house; the robot must thus confirm that a guest was calling and is willing to leave.

	\item \textbf{Cab/Taxi:} The cab location is identifiable by a \emph{Cab Driver}, who is wearing high-visibility clothing (e.g. a fluorescent vest) and is standing under an open umbrella.

	\item \textbf{Delivering coats:} Coats are hanging on a coat rack near the exit door.
	The robot should hook off the coats autonomously and bring them back to the right people.

	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reductions for human assistance are applied per guest as follows:
	\begin{table}[h]
		\begin{tabular}{m{0.8\linewidth} c}
			\textbf{Action} & \textbf{Reduction} \\\hline
			Telling the robot which guest is leaving (e.g. by pointing) & 30pts \\
			Guiding the robot to the cab & 40pts \\
			Guiding the robot back to the arena & 40pts \\
			Handing over a coat to the robot & 50pts \\\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Referee instructions}

The referees need to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Select at least 5 volunteers, and assign them names and coat colors.
	\item Choose the people that will call the robot.
	\item Assign a location for the the cab driver.
	\item Mind the robot when it goes outside the arena.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC instructions}

During the \SetupDays:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide coats for training.
	\item Provide an umbrella for training.
	\item Provide the cab driver's high-visibility clothing for training.
