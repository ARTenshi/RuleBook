\subsection*{Bonus Rewards}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Opening the entrance door to a guest (200pts each).
	\item Describe the first guest to the second guest  (100pts).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Setup and Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place in the living room.
	
	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts inside the arena at a predefined location near the entrance door.
	
	\item \textbf{Entrance:} The entrance door is open by default. The team leader can request to close the door to score additional points by opening it for the guests.

	\item \textbf{Host:} The host's name and favorite drink will be announced before the test. The host is already sitting in the living room.

	\item \textbf{Guests:} Both guests have a name and favorite drink. An arriving guest will either step in front of the robot or knock on the closed door. Guests have to be guided to the living room to be introduced.

	\item \textbf{Introductions:} When introducing guests, the robot must clearly identify the person being introduced and state their name and favorite drink. Introducing two people means to introduce them to each other.
	
	\item \textbf{Seating People:} The robot must point at a place or location where the guest can sit.
	
	\item \textbf{Switching Places:} Guests may switch places after they were seated.
	
	\item \textbf{Describing the First Guest:} Naming at least 4 characteristics of the first guest, i.e., color of clothes, color of hair, gender, and age, earns bonus points.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional Rules and Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Misunderstanding:} Not understanding the guests and asking them again is fine. Continuing with a wrong name or drink causes a score reduction of 50pts.
		
	\item \textbf{Partial Scoring:} The main task allows partial (per guest) scoring.
	
	\item \textbf{Deus ex Machina:} Score reduction applies per guest as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[nosep]
		\item \textbf{Custom Operator:} Since the main focus of the test is HRI, no custom operator can be chosen.
		\item \textbf{Alternative HRI:} Using an alternative HRI to understand a guest causes a score reduction of 75pts.
		\item \textbf{Recognizing People:} If the robot has to ask for help to identify people, score is reduced by 200pts. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
