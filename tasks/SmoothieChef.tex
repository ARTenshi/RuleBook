\section{Smoothie Chef [Party Host]}
The home owner will teach the robot to make a smoothie.

\subsection{Focus}
Learning from demonstration.

\subsection{Main Goal}
The home owner will teach the robot using demonstrations how to make a smoothie. The robot is then to repeat the task. The robot must indicate, on its own, how demonstrations will work, to the home owner. We will have the robot place the (fake) fruit corresponding to the desired smoothie into a bowl, which avoids needing blenders and needing to manipulate liquids. However, one of the fruits will be something small, like blueberries, which will need to be measured using an appropriate measuring cup.

\noindent\textbf{Reward:} 2500pts (500 points per ingredient).
